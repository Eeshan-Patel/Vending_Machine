### University of Sydney - Agile Software Development Group Project

Hello! I'm Eeshan Patel, the Product Owner of this dynamic Vending Machine Software Project. In this role, I steered our team's direction, ensuring alignment with our project goals. I meticulously monitored our progress using Burndown charts and also contributed to the coding aspect, helping in the development of key functionalities. Additionally, I took on the responsibility of unit testing and documenting the application development for all our sprints.

#### Project Overview
As a group of four students at the University of Sydney, we embarked on this project to implement Scrum practices and Agile development tools in creating a JAVA-based vending machine software. This software efficiently manages a Lite Snacks vending machine, featuring a variety of snacks in different categories.

  - Compile and execute the Java files to launch the application.

#### Agile Development and Scrum Practices
- Our development process was rooted in Scrum methodologies, with regular sprints and team meetings.
- We adopted CI/CD practices for efficient development and delivery.
- Extensive documentation of our Scrum events, user stories, and development progress was a key aspect of our project.

#### Personal Contributions
- Alongside my role as the Product Owner, I actively contributed to the coding of the application, playing a hands-on role in developing several functionalities.
- My involvement extended to unit testing, ensuring the robustness and reliability of our application.
- I was also responsible for creating comprehensive documentation that captured our development journey.
